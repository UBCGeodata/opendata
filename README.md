Software such as ArcGIS, QGIS are the most preferred programs to make use of this data. 

GitHub
------
* GitHub is used most often to host code for version control and collaboration. 
* It is also an easy way to make geospatial data browsable, viewable and downloadable.
* Information about using GitHub: [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

### Viewing spatial data in the repositories
* GitHub uses [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) to display any geojson file.
* You can click on any .geojson file and it will display as a map, allowing you to click on features.
* For example: [UBC Vancouver Buildings](https://github.com/UBCGeodata/ubcv-buildings/blob/master/geojson/ubcv_buildings.geojson)

### Downloading data
* You can get the whole repository of data by clicking on the green 'Clone or download' button on the right of page.
* For only a single type of data: 
 * Navigate to the location of the data you are interested in.
 *  For example  ubcv-locations > fgdb > ubcv_locations.gdb.zip 
 * Click the 'Download' button on the right side of the screen.
 * For a text file (like .geojson), you can right-click on the 'download' or 'raw' button and choose 'save link as'.
